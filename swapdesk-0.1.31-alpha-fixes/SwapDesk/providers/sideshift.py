        auth needed) and use it to REPLACE self.networks/self.names, so the
        app can offer every coin SideShift actually lists rather than just
        the hand-curated set.

        Each row carries its own authoritative "mainnet" field naming which
        of its listed networks is native -- confirmed live (e.g. BTC:
        networks ["bitcoin","liquid"], mainnet "bitcoin"; ETH: six networks
        including L2s, mainnet "ethereum"). That field is checked first and
        wins outright when present. Without it (a defensive fallback, not
        the expected path), the curated network id from constants.COINS is
        tried next via pick_native_network's `expected` parameter, and only
        as a last resort does a genuinely unlabelled multi-network coin fall
        back to the ticker-string-match heuristic. This matters because a
        plain ticker-match can't find the native row at all once a coin has
        several networks named as full chain words ("bitcoin"/"ethereum")
        rather than short tickers -- that used to make BOTH BTC and ETH
        "ambiguous" and drop them from SideShift entirely on every routine
        coin-list refresh, even though each one names its own native network
        explicitly. A multi-network coin with no usable signal at all is
        skipped rather than defaulted: this app has no per-coin network
        selector in the UI, so a wrong guess here means depositing to (or
        settling on) a chain the user never chose and can't see, which is how
        funds get sent across incompatible networks and lost. Returns
        {ticker: display_name} for the merged GUI list; raises on failure so
        callers can leave the curated defaults in place."""
