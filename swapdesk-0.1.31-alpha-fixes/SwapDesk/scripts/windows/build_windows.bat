REM build_windows.bat - build SwapDesk.exe on Windows.

REM Usage:
REM   build_windows.bat                 bring-your-own-keys build
REM   build_windows.bat --with-keys     bake in affiliate keys (keys.local.json
REM                                     or SWAPDESK_<PROVIDER>_API_KEY env vars)
REM
REM Run from anywhere: it cd's to the source root itself. PyInstaller does not
REM cross-compile, so this produces a Windows .exe only.

REM Tk is what CustomTkinter draws on, and the python.org installer lets it
REM be unticked. Without it PyInstaller has nothing to collect and the .exe
REM dies on first launch instead of failing here, where the cause is still
REM obvious. build_linux.sh and build_macos.command both check this; this
REM script was the one that did not.
