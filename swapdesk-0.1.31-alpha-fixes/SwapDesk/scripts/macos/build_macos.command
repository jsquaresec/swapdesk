#   ./build_macos.command                 bring-your-own-keys build
#   ./build_macos.command --with-keys     bake in affiliate keys (keys.local.json

# Run from anywhere, or double-click in Finder: it cd's to the source root

# only, and one that runs on the same architecture as the machine that built
# it (an Apple Silicon build will not run on an Intel Mac).
