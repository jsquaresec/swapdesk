"""
config.py: local, self-hosted config + history storage for SwapDesk.

Running from source, everything lives in a single folder next to the app
(portable install):
    ./data/config.json    provider API keys/secrets  (PLAINTEXT. See note)
    ./data/history.json    local record of created swaps

In a compiled build the app folder is a temp directory that PyInstaller
deletes on exit, so writable state moves to the platform's per-user location
instead: %APPDATA%\\SwapDesk, ~/Library/Application Support/SwapDesk, or
$XDG_DATA_HOME/SwapDesk. See _app_dir().

SECURITY NOTE
-------------
Provider credentials can be stored one of two ways:

* ENCRYPTED (recommended): set a master password and the keys live in
  data/config.enc, encrypted with AES-256-GCM under a scrypt-derived key
  (see secretbox.py). The plaintext config.json is shredded once the
  encrypted copy exists. Nothing on disk is readable without the password.
* PLAINTEXT (opt-out / no master password set): keys live in
  data/config.json in the clear, protected only by OS file permissions.
  This is the original behaviour, kept for headless/automated use where an
  interactive unlock prompt isn't possible.

Either way these are *affiliate/partner* credentials for creating swaps.
They are NOT wallet keys and cannot move your coins. Both files are created
with a restrictive ACL (Windows) / chmod 600 (POSIX) where possible, and the
data/ directory itself is locked to the current user.

history.json is the more privacy-sensitive of the two: it links your
provider, timestamps, deposit address, and destination address for every
swap you've ever made. auto_clear_history_days defaults to 90 (not 0/keep
forever) for that reason: change it in Settings if you want a different
window.
