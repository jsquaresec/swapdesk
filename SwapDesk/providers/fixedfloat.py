# FixedFloat: instant, non-custodial swap (API v2)
#
# Same fund flow as SideShift/ChangeNOW/Trocador: the provider hands back a
# single-use deposit address and settles the output straight to the user's
# address. No end-user account; the developer needs an API key + secret.
#
# Two things make FixedFloat's API different from the others here:
#   1. EVERY request is signed. X-API-SIGN = HMAC-SHA256(secret, body), where
#      `body` is the EXACT JSON string sent. So we must serialize the body
#      once, sign that exact string, and send that same string as the raw
#      request body. Never re-serialize via requests' json= (that would
#      change the bytes and break the signature). Because signing needs the
#      key, FixedFloat can't do keyless "public" quotes the way SideShift can.
#   2. Responses are enveloped as {code, msg, data}; code 0 means success.
#
# Rate type is "float" (variable): the estimate is indicative and the real
# rate fixes when the deposit is seen, consistent with the other providers.
# "fixed" would lock the rate ~10 min but costs more and auto-cancels if the
# market moves >~1.2%, which is a worse fit for a compare-then-send flow.
class FixedFloat(SwapProvider):
    # Read by preflight, same pattern as the other disclosure flags. True
    # means create_swap accepts refund_address for interface parity and does
    # not transmit it: FixedFloat's /create takes no refund destination, and
    # one is only chosen later through its emergency endpoint. Without the
    # flag, preflight green-ticked the field's format and the user reasonably
    # concluded it had been used.
