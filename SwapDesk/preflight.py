"""
preflight.py: a mandatory safety gate in front of create_swap().

Why this exists
----------------
Reading the code proves it builds the *right* request given a canned
response. It can't catch a live-API surprise, a typo in an address you
paste, or a moment of "I'll just trust the UI" before funds move. The one
failure mode that matters here, a wrong-chain send or a mangled memo, is
typically unrecoverable, not a bug you patch and refund. This module is the
last independent check before that happens, and it is deliberately NOT part
of the providers package: it must reason
about the request using information create_swap() doesn't have access to
(what you originally typed, what's in history, what the quote said a moment
ago) rather than just trusting the same variables create_swap() already
trusts.

What it checks, and why each one is here
-----------------------------------------
1. Address format sanity (config.address_looks_valid), catches paste
   errors/wrong-coin addresses before they reach a provider.
2. Coin/network pair is actually supported by the chosen provider, a
   provider that silently no-ops or errors deep in create_swap is better
   caught here, before you've committed to depositing.
3. Echo-back confirmation: prints the EXACT outbound settle_address and
   refund_address for you to visually diff against what you meant to type,
   because a variable getting silently reused/overwritten upstream (in your
   own calling code, not this app) would otherwise be invisible.
4. Address-reuse warning: flags if this destination was used before
   (privacy leak on transparent chains; also worth a second look in case
   it's not the address you meant to use this time).
5. Dry-run mode by default, get_quote() only, never create_swap(), unless
   you pass execute=True AND type the literal confirmation phrase. No
   flag-only bypass; the confirmation string must be typed interactively
   (or passed explicitly with an unambiguous CLI flag) so a script can't
   accidentally set execute=True and fire for real.
6. Post-creation verification: after a real swap is created, re-checks
   the destination against Swap.settle_address_confirmed_by_provider,
   which each provider populates from something it independently read
   back out of its own API response (SideShift's settleAddress,
   ChangeNOW's payoutAddress, FixedFloat's to.address).
   This is deliberately NOT a comparison against Swap.settle_address:
   that field is just the local variable echoed straight back through
   every provider's create_swap(), so comparing it to itself can never
   catch anything. When a provider's response has no independently-
   readable field, the check degrades to an explicit warning rather than
   a silent pass.

This is a safety NET, not a safety GUARANTEE. It cannot verify that the
provider's live API is behaving as documented, and it cannot verify your
clipboard/typing was correct. It can only verify internal consistency and
known-format sanity. Independent audit and small real-fund dogfooding are
still the only ways to close the remaining gaps.
